Linked Lists is a special type of a list. Each element of a the list has two attributes:
- it's value 
- a 'pointer' referencing to the memory location of the list's next element.

Linked lists are categorized in three subcategories:
- Singly linked lists  (each element references its subsequent counterpart in the list, last element obviously does not point anywhere)
- Doubly linked lists (each element references the next element in the sequence as well as the previous one)
- Circled linked lists (same as Singly linked lists with the only difference that the last element points to an element within the sequence. Therefore the sequence
                        looks like a closed curve).
                        
In this repository we implement the class for creating a node (element of a linked list) and its methods for manipulating a linked list (insert, remove,  lentgh etc)
We also implement an algorithm to recognize if the linked list is a closed curve or not.
